got work to do on beach input.
ultimately don't want to hard-code the drop-down.
need jinja loop that reads loc table. 
displays beach names. 
passes table's loc id

how to:
get locations objects from route
need a select tag to make dropdown
w/in select tags,
jinja for loop 
(for now no region opt group. maybe add later)
make <option> from selected attr of each loc object:
